## üöÄ Overview

**CompareMerge** is a professional macOS utility designed for developers, writers, and professionals who need to compare and merge files or folders efficiently. Instead of manually scanning documents line by line, CompareMerge provides an intuitive side-by-side comparison view that highlights every difference in detail.  

The app supports text files, source code, and entire folders, allowing users to identify additions, deletions, and changes instantly. It also includes powerful **merge functionality**, so you can selectively combine changes from two different files into one final version.  

For developers, CompareMerge integrates perfectly into workflows where version control and code management are critical. Writers, editors, and translators can use it to track changes between drafts. Businesses benefit from its ability to audit documents and maintain consistency across multiple versions.  

Its macOS-native design makes it lightweight, responsive, and reliable, whether you‚Äôre comparing a few lines of code or synchronizing entire project directories. CompareMerge simplifies collaboration and eliminates confusion when handling multiple file versions.
